	to probe for -lssl.

2003-05-19  Abigail Brady  <morwen@evilmagic.org>

	returns -1 for connect() immediately, move to the next one straight
	away.

	* cryotel.cc: When the connection to the mud is list, put a newline
	in our buffer if row != 0.  This stops the problem with prompts
	appearing randomly in the buffer after /// unable to connect lines.

	addresses.  Make the connect command be able to take exactly the same
	things as are passable on the command line.

	* Socket.cc, Socket.h: Add InAddr::create, to make an InAddr from a 
	sockaddr. (either 4 or 6).

	* *.cc: Make lots of files.
	
	* cryotel.cc: Add 'FLAG' support - interpret the characters between
	\0 \and \x1f interestingly for CP437.

	See <http://8bit.ath.cx/flag/>

	The other thing we need to do to support this 'standard', is to have
	it so that inverted bright text makes a bright background - which
	may be possible if we use the xterm 100m codes.

2002-12-06  Abigail Brady  <morwen@evilmagic.org>

	* cryotel.cc: Experimental support for the telnet MULTIPLEX option,

	If LINEMODE is negotiated, we assume it doesn't.

2002-11-22  Abigail Brady  <morwen@evilmagic.org>

	* cryotel.cc: Add support for some LPmuds broken prompt handling.
	This is enabled by default because it's implemented in such a way
	that it doesn't actually break any muds I've tested it on.

	If it does break your mud, please let me know, and I'll make it
	a default-to-off option instead.

	* cryotel.cc: Support the SGA option, as is required by RFC 1123.

2002-11-19  Abigail Brady  <morwen@evilmagic.org>

	* cryotel.cc: There's now a "match" command that inverts text that
	matches the given string. "match" on its own to turn off.  The tab
	key scrolls no the next instance of this string.

	interpreting the $<3> style delays in terminfo.

2002-11-10  Abigail Brady  <morwen@evilmagic.org>

2002-11-09  Abigail Brady  <morwen@evilmagic.org>

	with some muds.

	recieve	some IAC code from the mud.

2002-10-20  Abigail Brady  <morwen@evilmagic.org>

	* cryotel.cc: Escape IAC characters within IAC SB NAWS. Doh.

	any event. Helps with lagged connections.

	* cryotel.cc: Further character mode support. We enable character mode
	if the other end sends IAC DONT LINEMODE.
