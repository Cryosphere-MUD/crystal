If you use unix there are three options for mud clients.

  1. gui ones.     these invariably suck.
  2. telnet.       this rules but has no line editing feature, and other 
                   ugliness.
  3. console ones. these invariably suck.

So we've set out to make a new mud client. It's as close to telnet as possible,
except -

  * if stuff is sent to your screen it doesn't break the input line
  * you can use left arrow, right arrow, ^A, ^E and so in to edit the line
  * the input line scrolls left and right if it gets too big
  * you can page up and page down for scrollback.  This works in a split-screen
    fashion, so you can 
  * you can cursor up and down for a history.
  * there are a bunch of other commands

We aim to eventually have perfect ansi and telnet handling, but right now it's
just Good Enough (and better than 99% of mud clients out there).

We implement from telnet everything that's mandatory, and also

  EOR/GA - lp prompt grabbing
  NAWS - window size
  TTYPE - terminal type identification
  MCCP - mud compression

It links against openssl if available, and will then be able to connect to
telnets muds too.
