Crystal is a simple mud client for people who like telnet - people who were a bit
frustrated with clunky and intrusive interfaces.

It's as close to telnet as possible except -

  * if stuff is sent to your screen it doesn't break the input line
  * you can use left arrow, right arrow, ^A, ^E and so in to edit the line
  * the input line scrolls left and right if it gets too big
  * you can page up and page down for scrollback.  This works in a split-screen
    fashion, so you can 
  * you can cursor up and down for a history.
  * there are a bunch of other commands

We aim to eventually have perfect ANSI and telnet handling, but right now it's
just Good Enough.

We implement from telnet everything that's mandatory, and also

  EOR/GA - lp prompt grabbing
  NAWS - window size
  TTYPE - terminal type identification
  MCCP2 - mud compression

It links against openssl if available, and will then be able to connect to
telnets muds too.
