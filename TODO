TODO

* test on muds that aren't cryosphere
* better line editor
* customisable key bindings
* don't crash with stupidly long prompts
* scripting language support. triggers, custom commands.
* support for more than one mud in a window?
* better screen redraw - the current system sucks.


* evil plan with prompt interspersing as follows -

  we get sent >IAC GA
  user enters "blah", we send "blah\r\n"
  we display >blah
  user enters "foo", we send "foo\r\n"

  we display >blah
             foo
  
  we get sent "]IAC GA". we go back in the buffer, and alter what we
  have to >blah
          ]foo

  finally we get sent >IAC GA, so we display

          >blah
          ]foo
          >

  way to do this - if we were expecting an EOR/GA but didn't get one yet, 
  then rather than sending the echoed text to the buffer, put it in a list.
  this list is hooked into the display routines magically.
  then when an IAC EOR/GA happens, if we have something at the start of the 
  list, remove it from the list, and echo it after the IAC EOR/GA.

  Obviously this doesn't work in unterminated prompt mode. But that's ok.

DONE

* don't use fixed-width buffer for entering text
* make disconnected go into command mode
* MCCP support
* 256-color mode
* don't pad short lines with spaces, it confuses xterm's selection
* proper support for doublewidth characters
* fix problem with not resetting colour before drawing font
* only send xterm titles to "xterm", "xterm-color" or "screen"
* look up hostnames
* hostname/port selection in arg
* have ^]quit work as in telnet
* bell support (Don't try it at the moment, it just puts the bleep in the buffer and then keeps refreshing it)
* blank lines just disappear - why?
* is select() working properly?
* support for resizing screen
* scrollback
* remove curses
* support for underlines
* notice when connection closes
* figure out why the first prompt doesn't always get displayed (problem with eor handshaking probably - fixed at cryo end)
* get rid of pager prompts (mud sends a magic escape code)
* support for tabs
* input scrolling has broken in wide windows
* colour in prompt
* unicode support
* escape 0xff (y with umlaut)
* remove flickering
* make it so that if you hit "ESC" it doesn't sit there waiting forever for the next control character.  Argh.
* logging
* blocking connect looks silly. clear the command.
* local echo off
